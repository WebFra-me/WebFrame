# Contributing to WebFrame
### Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Webframe, which are hosted in the Webfra-me Organization on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Webframe Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Webfra-me/Webfra-me/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to info@webfra.me.

## Overview
There are many ways you can contribute to Webframe's core project. Here are some of the primary ways people contribute.

## Report a bug or request a feature
## For bugs:
Before creating bug reports, please check the [issues board](https://github.com/Webfra-me/Webfra-me/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

    Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the [template](https://github.com/Webfra-me/Webfra-me/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
* If you're reporting a server or php error, include a error report. Include the error report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.
* If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* Did the problem start happening recently or was this always a problem?
* Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* Which version of Webframe are you using? You can get the exact version by clicking on the i in the bottum right hand corner when you are logged in useing the default HUD.
* What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
* Are you running Webframe in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* Which packages do you have installed?
* How is you .ini and conf files configured?
